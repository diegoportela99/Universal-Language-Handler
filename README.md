# universal-language-handler README

say you are given the function:

// takes numbers a and b and returns the sum

function sum(int a, b) {
   return (a+b)
}

this function may or may not make sense to someone in say spain or japan, 
this program will convert given code files to universally readable functions based on selected languages

i.e. the new output for spainish would be as follows:

// toma los n√∫meros ayb y devuelve la suma

function suma(int a,b) {
   return (a+b)
}
